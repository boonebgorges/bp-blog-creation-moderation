This plugin is not working yet.

It will be used to augment the BuddyPress blog creation in the following ways:
- When creating a blog, users must specify a member who will approve the blog application
- The blog will not be created immediately, but a record of the application will be stored
- An email will be sent to the moderating member
- The member will then be able to click a link to approve the application, or to reject it
